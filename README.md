The functional code for this project comes from functional testing  https://github.com/lucien1995/QCT-MYOB-Automated-Data-Upload
it's the starting point of everything

At present, the communication with the API has been completed, and React will be introduced into this project to implement the front-end framework writing. 
From the current project complexity, using React may be too cumbersome, but considering the future project development, if chart generation and display are added, React will have better maintainability. In the future, it is possible to introduce PowerBI API to generate data charts. We will consider the applicability of react at that time.
